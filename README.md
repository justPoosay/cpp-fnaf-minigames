## Core Features

*   Smooth screen transitions
*   Faithful recreations of classic FNaF minigames.
*   Main menu with game selection and settings (resolution, graphics quality, CRT shader, volume)
*   Built-in developer console (toggle with `` ` `` or `~`):
    *   `HELP`: Displays available commands
    *   `CLEAR`: Clears the console output
    *   `TASKLIST`: Lists simulated running processes
    *   `TASKKILL <process> [/T][/F]`: "Terminates" simulated processes (e.g., `HELFY.ini`, `fazbOS.exe`)

## Technologies Used

*   **Language:** C++
*   **Build System:** Visual Studio
*   **Library:** Raylib (for graphics, audio, input)

## Getting Started

1.  **Prerequisites:** A C++ compiler, Raylib library installed
2.  **Compilation:** The game is precompiled ^^
3.  **Run:** Run the executable (`fazbOS.exe`). Make sure the `resources/` folder is next to the executable.

## Controls

*   **Menu:** Mouse
*   **Midnight Motorist:** `WASD` or `←↑↓→`.
*   **Chica's Magic Rainbow Land:** `←`/`→` (Left/Right), `↑` (Jump).
